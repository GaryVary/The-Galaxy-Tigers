Damage efficiency (flux/damage) is determined with damage/shot and energy/shot :
- Frag weapons : around 0.3
- Energy non beam : more than 1
Rate of fire is determined by burst delay
Damage per second is determined damage/second, same for flux/second. Can be useful for sustained beam weapons
Projectile HP (missiles and such) is determined by proj hitpoints
Projectile damage is determined by damage/shot
