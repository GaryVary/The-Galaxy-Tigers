galaxytigers_smolslaught,SHIP,"The Tareb has been created by the Hegemony in order to fill a gap into the heavy frigate demand. Being armed with that much mounts, including a medium one, and its unique X-Ray Pulse Cannons makes this little vessel a threat that shouldn't be ignored. Over time, its similar shape with the Onslaught and its XPCs gave the Tareb the honor to be nicknamed the ""Smallslaught"" (or ""Smolslaught"" for the pirates).",,,
galaxytigers_smolslaught_p,SHIP,"A stolen Tareb slightly customized by the pirates. Now featuring red stripes to feel more ""piratey"", the Tareb also got a bit of rework on its XPCs to overclock them. They will noww fire at an insane rate, but at the cost of a high flux generation and frequent overheats limiting the bursts to only a few blasts.",,,
galaxytigers_cerbherd,SHIP,"The Cerbherd is a multi purpose ship combining combat freighter, drone tender and some surveying equipment. Having light structure and armor makes the Cerbherd pretty agile and even frightening when it uses its maneuvering jets. Combining it with its shields and a good loadout will transform this vessel into a beast capable of taking down destroyers.",,,
galaxytigers_rana,SHIP,This vessel is a dangerous and agile frigate carrying an integrated Brattice (GT) wing and even a medium weapon slot. The weapons disposition and their coverage make the Rana a fairly versatile ship. The only downsides are its weak armor and slightly low hull integrity.,,,
galaxytigers_truck,SHIP,"The Truck is a multi purpose Buffalo hybrid made to convey cargo and fuel. While hampered by a less important cargo capacity than a standard Buffalo, this small inconvenient is caught up by a very decent fuel capacity. If you need a freighter and a tanker, but you are limited by your fleet capacity or the amount of credits you have, the Truck is a decent choice for your fleet.",,,
galaxytigers_taurus,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the early Domain drones, this craft has been developed from combined salvaged parts of the Explorarium drones and modern technological developments. Having strong armor, an impressive arsenal, a bay for fighters and a fully-functional military grade shield generator, it's functionnality as a frontline craft has not gone unused, and continues to this day.

This design has been used by the GT for a considerable time. An effective craft for quick fights, despite the ire it draws from the Hegemony, and more often the Luddic populous.
",,,
galaxytigers_trebuchet,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the early Domain drones, this craft has been developed from combined salvaged parts of the Explorarium drones and modern technological developments.

This design has been used by the GT for a considerable time. An effective escort and defense craft, despite the ire it draws from the Hegemony, and more often the Luddic populous.",,,
galaxytigers_keeper,SHIP,"Inspired by the Explorarium design of a Keeper drone, this model has been used since a long time by the Galaxy Tigers. The first ones were produced not long after drones were launched from a loose automated mother ship in the Tigris star system. After many days of battles, the many drone fleets eventually got defeated and Galaxy Tigers engineers began to study their structures to finally come up with new designs, if needed, fitting the faction's preferences. The new Keeper design gained structure integrity, a not-so-makeshift shield generator, an integrated Dual Flak cannon and the Spider Nest system at the cost of being forced to use 2 integrated fighter wings, some speed and maneuverability, an impact on its peak performance and more required supplies to maintain it.

Some tests made directly on field showed the potential of this drone, mostly for a very effective support role, and the Keeper quickly got its place in almost every GT fleet.
Nowadays, it is still in use in the faction, ignoring the Hegemony's requests to stop their production due to the fact that it is an automated ship. However, the others doens't seem to mind this, excepted for the Luddites.",,,
galaxytigers_bandit_mining,SHIP,"This Bandit model has been modified by the Galaxy Tigers to fit a utility needing. Normally seen in pirate fleets, this destroyer spiked the faction's interest by its good performances and resistance for a destroyer originaly made out of scraps. Many changes were made on this hull to make it even more resistent to be able to mine into asteroid belts as easily as possible.
Getting an integrated mining blaster normally reserved to blast bits of asteroids, it can also serve as an additive weapon for fighting, combined to the other weapon mounts and the main ballistic mount replaced by a missile mount. Other modifications also offered much more cargo space and thus added the possibility to integrate a mining drones wing as a replacement to the talon interceptors, but such massive changes got an impact on the shield emitter that got damaged and flux abilites got altered due to vents being condemned by heavy armor plates, not to mention a little impact on speed and maneuverability due to the heavier armor. Finally, the system got reprogrammed to house sensor drones at the cost of the burn drive functionnality being corrupted to an irremediable state.",,,
galaxytigers_bandit_combat,SHIP,"This Bandit model has been modified by the Galaxy Tigers to fit a heavier profile. Normally seen in pirate fleets, this destroyer spiked the faction's interest by its good performances and resistance for a destroyer originaly made out of scraps. Many changes were made on this hull to make it even more resistent to be able to stay longer on the frontline.
Its main ballistic mount got replaced by a compostive mount, the intregrated talon interceptors got removed to let commanders use their preferred wing and the system got reprogrammed to switch its burn drive ability with the ammo feed one. On the other side, the overall speed and maneuverability got reduced a bit due to the heavier armor.",,,
galaxytigers_fortress,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the early Domain Fortress drone, this craft has been developed from salvaged parts off of the Explorarium's drone and was re-imagined using more modern technological developments and ever-so-slightly changed to fit the desires of the GT's Naval Authority. Getting improved agility from modernization and a fully-functional military grade shield generator, it's functionality as a defensive and cargo craft has not gone unused, and continues to this day.

This design has been used by the GT for a considerable time. An effective escort, defense and conveying craft, despite the ire it draws from the Hegemony, and more often the Luddic populous.",,,
galaxytigers_rampart,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the early Domain Rampart drone, this craft has been developed from salvaged parts off of the Explorarium's drone and was re-imagined using more modern technological developments and ever-so-slightly changed to fit the desires of the GT's Naval Authority. Getting improved agility from modernization, weapon mounts modifications, an integrated Ion Beam and a fully-functional military grade shield generator, it's functionality as a defensive craft has not gone unused, and continues to this day.

This design has been used by the GT for a considerable time. An effective escort and defense craft, despite the ire it draws from the Hegemony, and more often the Luddic populous.",,,
galaxytigers_shield_maiden,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the early Domain drones, this craft has been developed from combined salvaged parts of the Explorarium drones and modern technological developments. Featuring a strong armor, an upsized arsenal and a fully-functional military grade shield generator, it's functionnality as a frontline and heavy support craft has not gone unused, and continues to this day.

This design has been used by the GT for a considerable time. An effective craft for quick fights or long range artillery support, despite the ire it draws from the Hegemony, and more often the Luddic populous.",,,
galaxytigers_barn,SHIP,"The Barn is an automated vessel inspired from the early Domain Rampart drone. It was developed from salvaged parts off the Explorarium's drone and was re-imagined using more modern technological developments and ever-so-slightly changed to fit the desires of the GT's civilian fleets. Many changes allowed the craft to serve as a multitask drone able to transport cargo, fuel and people.

This design has been used by the GT for a considerable time. An effective conveying craft, despite the ire it draws from the Hegemony, and more often the Luddic populous.",,,
galaxytigers_heron,SHIP,"This Heron model has been modified by the Galaxy Tigers to fit a heavier profile of carrier, getting more armor, hull integrity, a fourth fighter bay, changes on some weapon points and an integrated pulse laser at the cost of some cargo capacity and maximum speed, not to forget a bit more of required crew for the new fighter bay and mostly its Operations Points staying at the same amount as before.

The Heron provides the strategic and tactical mobility of a cruiser with potential firepower limited only by available strike-craft. It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleet of an admiral who knows when to take the initiative, hit quickly, and withdraw while enemy forces are still responding to the threat.

Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, a strategic shift that would reverse itself as a natural reaction against tradition from each successive generation of Armada officers. This process was occurring once more in the years immediately preceding the fall of the gate system and, in something of a coup for the so-called �Cruiser School�, the forward-thinking Altair Exotech won the Heron design contract over the traditional manufacturer of heavy Armada warships, Orion Shipyards. 

However the doctrinal shift embodied by the Heron was interrupted by the isolation of The Fall, and as such it is not often found in core Hegemony fleets (whose officers still cling to tradition). This hull has however found great popularity among the independent worlds, megacorporations, and mercenary forces of the Sector that tend to field leaner, faster fleets.",,,
galaxytigers_puma,SHIP,"The Puma was born from a desire of a fleet commander to possess a carrier that can also serve as an artillery platform. The name was chosen due to the ship system providing a significant weapon range boost, thus reminding the capacity of a feline species that used to live on Old Earth, the puma, to leap on its prey from high places as well as being the one which could jump the highest.",,,
galaxytigers_aurora,SHIP,"This Aurora model has been modified by the Galaxy Tigers to fit their preferences. It gets some more armor, hull integrity, a built-in Extended Shields hull mod and changes on some weapon points at the cost of a bit of cargo capacity and maximum speed as well as some more required crew to help maintaining the ship.

The Aurora-class cruiser is a technological marvel, rarely seen. Among the fastest and most maneuverable cruisers in the Sector, it is also one of the safest due to its wide shield coverage. 

One can only wonder what the Domain Navy could accomplish with a fleet of these sleek, asymmetric, and eminently effective vessels. The shields are backed up by hyper-advanced flux dissipation systems installed throughout the hull, which gives the Aurora a deep flux pool.

Most blueprints required to manufacture Aurora-class ships are closely guarded corporate secrets, but a few have also seen service in Tri-Tachyon fleets and, rarely, in the hands of enterprising mercenary captains.

Few ships can outperform the Aurora ton for ton. Its only weakness is its prohibitive cost.",,,
galaxytigers_kandorig,SHIP,"The Kandorig is a multi purpose ship combining carrier, mining and salvage utilities created a few years ago in order to get an efficient and very versatile ship for a very low material cost. What it lacks in medium or large weapon mounts and mobility is countered by 3 fighter bays and a decent Operation Points amount. However, with a good loadout, this ship can become a real monster.",,,
galaxytigers_ethrom,SHIP,"The Ethrom is a design inspired from the Domain-era automated ships. Combining the rough design of those good old hulls with a bit of imagination, this automated vessel is a real threat with its modules and its Optimized AI Processing helping a lot deployed friendly drones. Tanky and multirole, facing one of those shouldn't be considered lightly. Proceed with caution.",,,
galaxytigers_reinforcer,SHIP,"A rarely seen heavy automated vessel built within GT factories, the Reinforcer combines acceptable conveying capacities with a military sized amount of weapon mounts. First inspired from the Domain era drones, the prototypes were developed by mixing up salvaged parts of the many Explorarium drones, followed by technological developments years passing. Housing 2 smaller drones that can be deployed thanks to its ship system, it's functionnality as a conveying and defensive craft has not gone unused and is nowadays a pride of the GT's Navy.",,,
galaxytigers_sanctum,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the early Domain drones, this craft has been developed from combined salvaged parts of the Explorarium drones and modern technological developments. Featuring a heavy armor, a ridiculous amount of fighter bays and two fully-functional military grade shield generators mounted on separate rotating modules, it's functionnality as a heavy automated carrier has not gone unused, and continues to this day.

This design has been used by the GT for a considerable time. An effective craft for long range support, despite the ire it draws from the Hegemony, and more often the Luddic populous.",,,
galaxytigers_conquest,SHIP,"This Conquest model has been modified by the Galaxy Tigers to fit a heavier profile of ship. The changes include more hull integrity, armor and the conversion of 2 large weapon points to composite points at the cost of speed and maneuverability.

The Conquest-class battlecruiser is the embodiment of concentrated firepower. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers. 

Fortune favors the bold, the ancients said. This class of ships does indeed favor the bold captain, willing to risk everything for the thrill of victory.",,,
galaxytigers_baguette_p,SHIP,"Basicaly a large piece of junk, this ship has nonetheless some potential. The pirates used scraps salvaged here and there of an all-mighty battleship used by the Galaxy Tigers, the Baguette, wrapped around a circular chassis. The pirate design is not that different of the original one, even though it is way more fragile and has poor shield efficiency due to the generator being damaged. The good points are still good results in speed and maneuverability tests showing almost a destoyer-like agility and an acceptable firepower reinforced with the Accelerated Ammo Feeder system.",,,
galaxytigers_atlas_fortress,SHIP,"This ship is a redesigned Atlas MK. II hull fitting a more battlecarrier-like profile. Trading some turret slots to enable more accessibility to the launch bays, the Atlass Fortress also got much more protected by its heavier armor and overall structure, not to mention better flux-related capacities with the exception of the shield generator that got a bit damaged by the modifications. In an addition, the original ship system got replaced by a new one made to control Defender (GT) drones for an escort duty.",,,
galaxytigers_atlas_h,SHIP,"The Onslaught (A) is the result of a lack of time from the Hegemony to assemble proper Onslaughts. Using what the engineers could grab, this vessel features an (almost) true Onslaught, only lacking its back and replaced with an Atlas' one. While still fairly capable, the ship is missing its missile weapon mounts, thus considerably weakening its frontal firepower.",,,
galaxytigers_true_baguette,SHIP,"""Commandew, it's a baguette. We somehow weceived a wecipe too...""

galaxytigers_survey_mothership,SHIP,"An old automated vessel supposedly used for exploring and analyzing outer systems during the Domain era. Considering the bulk, the state and the armaments of this drone, it is reasonable to question if it was more a military vessel than an exploration one.",,,
,,,,,
#Wings,,,,,
galaxytigers_watchtower,SHIP,"Cheap to mount and yet effective, the Watchtower wing is the GT equivalent of the Talon interceptors. Equiped of 2 Asteroid PD Systems, a Watchtower squadron will be able to take down many minor threat with a correct efficiency. Their only drawback is the incapability of operating far from their carrier.",,,
galaxytigers_arrowtip,SHIP,"The Arrowtip bomber wing is a Domain-era inspired drone especially made to reduce lost lives during bombing runs. Equiped of 2 Toucan Torpedoes and 2 Light Machine Guns, any unshielded target will take serious damage if every torpedo hit.",,,
galaxytigers_drone_spider,SHIP,"Agile and particulary effective in swarms, the Spider drone is equiped of 2 Ion cannons for a high EMP potential. While being very useful against a single target and a nightmare for lone frigates, it may have a harder time when facing many opponents.",,,
galaxytigers_brattice,SHIP,"Autonomous AI interceptor inspired by the Explorarium design of a Brattice drone. Its former weapon got replaced by a light mortar, and the drone itself was built with a shield generator with a particularly terrible efficiency. Still fairly capable, it can be useful to tear enemy armor apart, slowly and steadily, for a very cheap cost.",,,
galaxytigers_bristol_H5S5,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the old aircrafts that were once used when humans were still living on Old Earth, the Bristol H5S5 armada is composed of 5 vessels armed of a Micro Bolter and a very small annihilator pod in order to complete support and pressure roles with acceptable efficiency, while also being able to boost its overall agility using its system.",,,
galaxytigers_buster_B10,SHIP,"With inspiration drawn from the old aircrafts that were once used when humans were still living on Old Earth, the Buster B10 armada is composed of 3 vessels armed with a Patience Minelayer, to land lines of static EMP mines, and a Light Machinegun. While being very adequate to pressure hostiles, these EMP mines are so unstable that they can't remain on the battlefield for too long, thus self-destructing themselves after a few seconds.",,,
galaxytigers_defender_system,SHIP,"A modified Defender (GT) drone suited for being a fighter wing. Everything on this vessel has been optimized to make sure it is able to do its job at the best of its potential, from the weapons to the engine modifications to make it even faster and more agile.",,,
galaxytigers_warden_wing,SHIP,A modified Warden (GT) drone suited for being a fighter wing. Everything on this vessel has been optimized to make sure it is able to do its job at the best of its potential.,,,

galaxytigers_picket_wing,SHIP,A modified Picket (GT) drone suited for being a fighter wing. Everything on this vessel has been optimized to make sure it is able to do its job at the best of its potential.,,,
,,,,,
#Weapons,,,,,
galaxytigers_lighter_needler,WEAPON,"A design based on the Light Needler. The decreased munition size allows for a staged auto-loader design, dramatically improving downtime between bursts and thus putting constant pressure on a target.",,,
galaxytigers_asteroid_pd,WEAPON,"Simple design that can serve a PD duty as well as a close fighting one. Dealing decent energy damage delivered in quick bursts, this weapon is adequate to get rid of nearby small threats.",,,
galaxytigers_patience_minelayer,WEAPON,Releases a line of static EMP mines equipped with a proximity fuse. The EMP charge is however so unstable for these small devices that they can't stay for too long on the battlefield.,,,
galaxytigers_wallbrick_gun,WEAPON,"A very special weapon carrying a rarely seen type of ammunition. Firing bursts of 3 bullets, a direct hit on hull will result in a strange reaction taking priority over any imput the target may have, thus forcing a brief derivation following the velocity of the slug that hit the vessel.",,,
galaxytigers_wallbrick_cannon,WEAPON,"A very special weapon carrying a rarely seen type of ammunition. Being the big brother of the Wallbrick Gun, the Wallbrick Cannon fires bursts of 4 bullets. If any of its bullets hit directly a hull, a strange reaction will occur taking priority over any imput the target may have, thus forcing a brief derivation following the velocity of the slug that hit the vessel.",,,
galaxytigers_toucan_single,WEAPON,"The Toucan torpedo is a simple unguided device designed to deliver a high energetic payload. While being bulky, it is hampered by its slowness, exposing it to PD weapons.

This mount features only a single torpedo.",,,
galaxytigers_toucan,WEAPON,"The Toucan torpedo is a simple unguided device designed to deliver a high energetic payload. While being bulky, it is hampered by its slowness, exposing it to PD weapons.

This mount features 4 Toucan Torpedoes.",,,
galaxytigers_deactite,WEAPON,The Deactite Waver is a cheap but efficient support weapon sending 3 multi directionnal waves in front of it. Each wave offers a high EMP payload that can disable multiple weapons. The only drawback is the damage potential being fairly low.,,,
galaxytigers_xpc,WEAPON,"The XPC was developped in the continuity of the Thermal Pulse Cannon but using the x-ray technology combined with a lighter pulser to finally get mounted onto the Smolslaught's arms. Even though it doesn't fire as the same rate as its bigger brother, it is compensated by a good damaging potential.",,,
galaxytigers_overclocked_xpc,WEAPON,"The overclocked XPC is a modification made by the pirates in an attempt to get even more firepower from it. Now firing at an insane rate, the weapon's systems can quickly get overloaded and needs a bit of time to cool itself down before being able to refire again.",,,
galaxytigers_shrapnolt,WEAPON,"The Shrapnolt Gun was formerly created to fill an area point-defense role, shooting 15 slugs per second in many directions. While being correctly effective to get down missile and fighter swarms, it lacks accuracy to hit a single target unless it's a big one like a cruiser or even a capital. Given the fact their armor has been stripped away, the Shrapnolt Gun should be able to hurt their structure a lot.",,,
galaxytigers_meteor_strike,WEAPON,"The Galaxy Tigers once needed to find an alternative to the Hephaestus Assault Gun due to a shortage of those weapons into their stocks. Engineers came out with this rough but effective design. Trading HE damage for Energy damage, the Meteor Strike Cannon shoots at a much better rate than the Hephaestus, however sustained firing usually lead to an accuracy loss.",,,
galaxytigers_claw_mirv,WEAPON,"The biggest version of the Tiger's MIRV family, the Tiger's Claw launcher houses many rockets that it shoots by salvos of 4 to put targets under pressure. Every rocket will hyperdrive above their target in order to attack them from behind when splitting the warheads. The system is however very unstable, making the splitting process fail from time to time. If this would happen, the backup system will be used if the missile go too far away from its target, emitting EMP arcs toward its prey while destroying itself. Used in numbers, this weapon is a convenient choice to pressure enemy ships and strip their armor.",,,
galaxytigers_fang_mirv,WEAPON,"The medium member of the Tiger's MIRV family, the Tiger's Fang launcher houses a handful of rockets that it shoots by salvos of 2 to put targets under pressure. Every rocket will hyperdrive above their target in order to attack them from behind when splitting the warheads. The system is however very unstable, making the splitting process fail from time to time. If this would happen, the backup system will be used if the missile go too far away from its target, emitting EMP arcs toward its prey while destroying itself. Used in numbers, this weapon is a convenient choice to pressure enemy ships and strip their armor.",,,
galaxytigers_paw_mirv,WEAPON,"The smallest member of the Tiger's MIRV family, the Tiger's Paw launcher houses a few rockets that it shoots one by one to put targets under small pressure. Every rocket will hyperdrive above their target in order to attack them from behind when splitting the warheads. The system is however very unstable, making the splitting process fail from time to time. If this would happen, the backup system will be used if the missile go too far away from its target, emitting EMP arcs toward its prey while destroying itself. Used in numbers, this weapon is a convenient choice to pressure enemy ships and strip their armor.",,,

#Entities,,,,,
galaxytigers_researchbase,CUSTOM,"This research station bears the markings of the Galaxy Tigers faction and looks to be abandoned since many years. It was probably built to study planets or anything of interest, but seeing what remains of it tells your crew that something may have happened to it in the past and its security systems weren't sufficient. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
galaxytigers_mining,CUSTOM,"This mining station bears the markings of the Galaxy Tigers faction and looks to be abandoned since many years. It once served to sustain the needings and wealth of this faction. Whatever happened shows some signs of an evacuation and it looks like the security systems weren't enough to stop the danger. At least, some goodies may have been left behind... Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
galaxytigers_habitat,CUSTOM,This habitat bears the markings of the Galaxy Tigers faction and looks to be abandonned since many years. There might be some power or emergency power left seeing an occasionnal light flicker or a door from a docking bay closing or opening for some reason. Checking its structure showed some holes and impacts usually occasioned during fights. Closer inspection may yield salvage.,,,

#Factions,,,,,
galaxytigers,FACTION,"The Galaxy Tigers are a conglomerate of many kind of people, from humble farmers to well-known scientists, which was originaly a simple group of dozens of people working for Tri-Tachyon who colonized a planet into the Tigris star system. Their decision to leave the megacorporation is nowadays unknown. Some say that it was because of a disagreement, others that they just got fired for some reason.

The colony eventually became to grow in terms of population and reputation and soon became a notorious passageway for anyone going, or coming back, for a long journey. At some point, survey ships got sent to the other system's planets to discover potential resources that may help the faction getting more independent and every Tigris' planets slowly got colonized one by one. The now well-established group began to claim their name as the Galaxy Tigers since.

Some years before the Collapse and not long after the third wave of autonomous exploration ships got sent, a loose mothership escorted by some other automated entities got in the system. Worried, the leader asked some fleets to follow the vessels at a safe distance to make sure they won't encounter anything that would be considered as hostile to them. As soon as the fleets got near the automated ships, many radar signatures coming from inside the vessels got detected. Those signatures were automated drones that got deployed against the Galaxy Tigers forces. Their hostile behaviour forced the faction to open fire against the drones, which got more agressive reactions now coming directly from the mothership and its escort as a result. The fight last for almost 4 days and resulted as a victory for the Galaxy Tigers, but at the price of many casualties.

Every ex-automated vessels got scavenged and studied by engineers following the orders of the leader to find a way to re-use them. The engineers eventually came up with ideas of designs, a way to reprogram the existing AIs that were used in the original drones and to transfer this program to newly built AIs, and a very detailed process in order to be able to build their own drones. Not long after, the production started, the salvaged vessels got restored and soon the first Galaxy Tigers drones got their uses in many fleets for testing purposes.

The tests lasted during many years, even after the Collapse, and showed many good reports. They ended when the First AI War broke. The Galaxy Tigers joined the forces of Tri-Tachyon, with which they were still in good terms, and the Persean League. The faction didn't involved itself in many battles, excepted when it was to protect the megacorp or themselves, but still suffered some casualties which were for the very most drone ships. Since then, tensions between the opposing Hegemony and Luddic Church against the Galaxy Tigers remained.

Inbetween the AI wars, the faction growth exploded so much that they could afford to begin colonizing outer systems, named Project ""New Beginnings"". However this expansion hope didn't last long when the Second AI War broke. With the will to help Tri-Tachyon came pressure from the opposing factions, which resulted in attacks onto outer system stations and such. Due to this, the project got suspended and most of the population retreated to the Tigris system which got heavy security reinforcements.

Even after the treaty, Project ""New Beginnings"" was never brought back, the leader not willing to bring their population into unwanted danger again and the tensions are still here, mostly with the Hegemony, because the Galaxy Tigers refuse to follow the High Hegemon's orders of bringing the automated drones down, from what is left of the very first ones that were the salvaged vessels, to the newly produced ones.",,,

#Planet types,,,,,
galaxytigers_tundra,PLANET,"A terran-extreme variant world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere maintained by a relatively subdued biosphere that exists largely within the oceans that undergo periodic thaw periods. The surface is very cold indeed, but it is human-viable if precautions are observed. Carbon dioxide may freeze out of the atmosphere at the poles during the local winter.",,,
galaxytigers_gas_giant,PLANET,"Primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. The temperature and pressure at the core are extreme, but not enough to sustain the deuterium fusion that would turn the planet into a brown dwarf star.",,,

#Planets,,,,,
galaxytigers_planet_tergess,CUSTOM,"Tergess is a tundra world that was the very first planet the Galaxy Tigers colonized. It caught their eyes by its potential and since it also was the only habitable planet they came across, the GT settled in. By years passing, Tergess became their center of operations, either military or commercial, and is nowadays one of their most valued properties. It is also rumored that the drone mothership from the Domain era they fought against in the past is stocked here.",,"When orbiting Tergess high in its skies, you are soon welcomed by the sight of many lights of the cities built on the planet. Apparently, it is here that a derelict mothership from the prosperous Domain era is being kept. Maybe it is stocked where that isolated light stands?",
galaxytigers_planet_assekia,CUSTOM,"Even though Assekia is another dead rock along other ones commonly found in the Sector, the Galaxy Tigers still found uses for this planet as a secondary military base. Bunkers and military structures have been built over time, and now Assekia is an effective fortress sending out reinforcements and patrols.",,"Military ships of various sizes can be seen flying around and coming in and out from many structures. From humand-piloted ones to automated vessels, they are particularly numerous and some of your crew members are almost panicking while you approach the planet.",
